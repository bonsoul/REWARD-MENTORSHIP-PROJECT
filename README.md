### **Reward Program Dashboard & Data Analysis Project**  

I developed a **Reward Program Dashboard** to analyze and optimize the effectiveness of a user reward system. This project aimed to enhance user engagement by providing actionable insights into mentorship activities and reward allocations.

#### **Project Overview:**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
  - Identified and removed duplicate and inconsistent records.  
  - Standardized data formats and handled missing values.  
  - Merged multiple data sources to ensure a comprehensive dataset for analysis.  

- **Point Allocation System:**  
  - Implemented an automated point calculation system based on predefined criteria.  
  - Allocated mentor points based on session participation, duration, and mentee engagement.  
  - Ensured transparency by documenting all calculations and validation processes.  

- **Reward Program Dashboard (Power BI):**  
  - Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights.  
  - Tracked **user engagement**, **mentor performance**, and **reward redemption patterns**.  
  - Implemented **segmentation analysis** to categorize users (e.g., new users, top performers, low engagement users).  

- **Key Insights & Recommendations:**  
  - Identified trends in mentorship participation and reward effectiveness.  
  - Provided data-driven recommendations to improve reward structures and increase user retention.  
  - Suggested optimizations for incentive strategies to enhance user motivation.  

This project demonstrates my expertise in **data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and strategic decision-making**. The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to track program success and make data-driven improvements to the reward system.
